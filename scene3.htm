		<p id="scene3ending1option1" style="display:none;">You see the turtle and jump on the evil being.<br /><br />Most people may not do this as a natural reaction to seeing a turtle, but you are not most people.<br /><br />You are Super Mario - so it all makes sense!</p>
		<p id="scene3ending1option2" style="display:none;">You see the turtle and watch it as it comes ever closer too you. As soon as it touches you the world spins and you find yourself back where you started.<br /><br />As it turns out, you are Super Mario - so it all makes sense!</p>

		<p style="font-weight:bold">Context is everything, without it you can't make informed decisions.<br /><br />Without the context a good story creates, Mario is just a deranged plumber killing turtles and ransacking castles.</p>
